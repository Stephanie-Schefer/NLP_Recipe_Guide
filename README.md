#### Project Overview
- To accomplish for NLP Final Project
    - **Recipe Recommendation System:** Develop an NLP-based recommendation system that suggests recipes to users based on their dietary preferences, ingredients on hand, previous cooking history, or user reviews.
- If time allows/ next iterations
    - **Cooking Instructions Simplification:** Develop an NLP algorithm to simplify complex cooking instructions in recipes, making them easier to understand and follow.

#### We are researching ingredient interactions and sustainable practices relating to food diets because it can be challenging and time consuming to research new recipes in order to enhance the recipe ideation process while reducing ingredient wastage and mirroring market preference trends.

#### Topics to Investigate
- consumer preferences
    - Understanding consumer tastes, dietary preferences, cultural influences, and regional variations can help tailor recipes that resonate with the target audience.
- ingredient interactions
    -Studying how different ingredients interact chemically and functionally can lead to better formulations, improving taste, texture, and overall quality of dishes.
- food science and technology
    -Exploring advancements in food technology and techniques can aid in developing innovative methods for ingredient utilization, preservation, and enhancement of nutritional value.
- sustainability practices
    - Investigating sustainable sourcing methods, reducing food waste, and utilizing environmentally friendly ingredients align with contemporary consumer values and global sustainability goals.
- market trends and analysis
    - Researching market trends, emerging ingredients, and culinary innovations can provide insights into evolving consumer demands and competitive landscape, aiding in creating market-relevant recipes.
- culinary techniques and cooking methods
    - Studying different cooking methods and culinary techniques can optimize ingredient use and enhance flavor profiles in recipes.
- packaging and storage solutions
    - Exploring efficient packaging and storage methods can help prolong ingredient shelf life, reducing wastage and ensuring freshness.
